Two-Factor Authentication Recovery Codes - https://www.sastechsolution.com (kritsadee)

Each line of 16 letters and numbers is a single recovery code, with optional spaces for readability. To use a recovery code, after entering your username and password, enter the code like "1234 5678 90AB CDEF" at the 2FA prompt. If your site has a custom login prompt and does not show a 2FA prompt, you can use the single-step method by entering your password and the code together in the Password field, like "mypassword1234 5678 90AB CDEF". Your recovery codes are:

f953 c653 7d18 c23a
